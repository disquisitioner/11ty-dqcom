title: Alas, the Disapperance of Dweet.io

    Alas the quiet disappearance of Dweet.io, a nifty "device tweeting"
    service I've used in my IoT projects since it launched in 2014 (but which
    you've probably never heard of). But perhaps it's not the end?

<!-- The post starts here -->
<p>
  In 2014 the fine folks at 
  <a href="https://www.buglabs.net/">Bug Labs</a> launched Dweet.io, 
  a free internet service
  built to allow connected devices to post short, ephemeral messages containing
  simple custom data payloads. The (excellent) idea behind the name is that was "Twitter
  for devices" and so the messages published were "dweets" (as in "device tweets").
  I loved the idea and incorporated Dweet support in most of my IoT projects, 
  valuing its easy way to publish and view status messages from devices that 
  didn't have a display, serial port, or log.  Want to know if the home weather 
  station is operating properly? Check to see what its latest "dweet" contained 
  and when it was posted, which you could do from any internet connected device 
  anywhere.
</p>
<p>
  Several weeks ago Dweet.io went silent, by which I mean the website
  disappeared altogether and the service stopped allowing connections
  to post or retrieve dweets.
  I struggled a bit to figure out why given the entire site vanished, but 
  eventually reached someone at Buglabs who explained they'd shut 
  everything down. Alas.
</p>
<p>
  Happily some anonymous folks have launched
  <a href="https://dweet.me">Dweet.me</a>, which looks very similar to the
  original but is still quite bareboned -- no documentation and no mention of
  client libraries, but their <a href="https://github.com/dweetme">GitHub</a>
  work is starting to grow and includes a Python client repo. Use of Dweet.me
  continues to be free, which is great. They're also occasionally active on 
  Bluesky at 
  <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dweet.me">@dweet.me</a> 
</p>
<p>
  I'm cautiously exploring moving my devices onto Dweet.me as its API
  and interfaces are slightly different. For now anything here that depended on 
  Dweet.io, e.g., my 
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/apps/dweetview/">Dweet Viewer</a> app, is 
  broken. Sorry about that. I'll need to modify code compiled and loaded
  into each dweeting device plus a few Python-based applications on Raspberry
  Pi systems here and there. Much of that will find its way into GitHub repos
  associated with those projects. I'll then need to tweak things here to use Dweet.me.
  I'll keep you posted.
</p>
<p>
  I want to express my appreciation to Bug Labs for conceiving, building
  and operating Dweet.io for over a decade! Hopefully it can live on as Dweet.me
  and perhaps grow as a community project.
