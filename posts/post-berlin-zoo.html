As part of our stay in Berlin this past week we had a chance to visit the <a href="https://www.zoo-berlin.de/en">Berlin Zoo</a>, Germany’s oldest zoological garden and home to the world’s largest variety of species (20,000 animals of around 1,300 species on the zoo grounds).  It's also the home to Germany's only Giant Pandas, which were especially popular given the recent arrival of twin cubs.  The weather was rainy and cold so only some of the animals were outside, but we were impressed nonetheless.  The Berlin Aquarium is also part of the Zoo experience, with fresh and salt water fish as well as reptiles and amphibians on display.  We'll have to come back when we're in Berlin later in the season and the weather is more enjoyable for people and animals alike. In the meantime, you can see <a class="piclink" href="https://davidbryant.smugmug.com/Berlin-Zoo">a gallery</a> of the photos I took while there (like the pensive chimpanzee above).
