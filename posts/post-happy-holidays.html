	Christmas is at last upon us, and I'm delighted to have some time to unwind.  Thanks to both Christmas and New Years being on a Wednesday I get what amounts to two weeks off as most folks at work are away some combination of Christmas week and New Years week.

	Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year!
