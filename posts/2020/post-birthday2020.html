	Today is my birthday.  Naturally our plans for a bit of family celebration had to change due to the quarantine, but we made it work thanks to email, text messages, Slack, and good old-fashioned phone calls.  Thankfully birthday cake delivery is enough of an essential service for the carrot bundt cake my awesome work colleagues ordered for me to arrive.  And I've had unusual birthdays before, none more bizarrely memorable than 1964 when my birthday fell on Good Friday, and was the day of the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/events/alaska1964/">Great Alaska Earthquake</a> (magnitude 9.2!), and on top of all that I was sick with chickenpox.  I still remember that day quite clearly, and am pretty sure I'll long recall this one like that too.
