title: I Voted!
description: I always vote, and love the "I Voted!" stickers you get from the official polling place.  This election we voted by mail, but thanks to California's ballot tracking service we not only are sure our ballots got in to be counted we still got an "I Voted!" (virtual) sticker!

	Got email confirmation today from the Santa Cruz County Elections Department that they've received my ballot for the November 3rd election, and that my vote will be counted.  "Where's My Ballot?" is is a service of the California Secretary of State through each local county election office, and was enabled as an option I could select on the ballot envelope itself.  I'm impressed -- great idea to do this.

	Oh, and my wife hand delivered our signed and sealed ballots to the Santa Cruz County Elections Department through one of their official drop boxes.  Happy to be able to do that, and to expedite getting our votes into the process to be counted.
