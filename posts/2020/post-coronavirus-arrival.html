We flew into Santiago this past weekend as the beginning of our adventure holiday in Chile, and deplaned to see this sign in the arrivals area.  The Ministry of Health had quickly established a screening process that checks every arriving passenger's temperature and asks if they had any symptoms of illness as well as what countries they'd visited in the last thirty days.  Everyone also gets a bit of paper with a toll-free number to call if you begin to feel sick at any point.  The line to be screened was long, adding an extra hour to the arrivals process, but given the Coronavirus outbreak it was both expected and welcome.

It does feel a bit strange to be traveling and we're cautious about everything, but we're well,there are few cases so far in Chile, and we've had this trip planned for almost a year.
