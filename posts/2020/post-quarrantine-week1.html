	After one week of "shelter in place" here's what I've learned:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Working from home everyday means no commute to and from the office, which has been amazing.  I knew from my regular work-from-home days that no commute meant a bit of extra sleep and time to begin/end the day.  I didn't, though, realize what a big deal that'd be when it was a feature of every day.  I fear it'll be hard to go back to commuting when the time comes.

			A roll of toilet paper lasts about six days.  Your mileage obviously may vary.
		</li>
		<li>
			Mozilla's well-established remote employee culture is a huge source of comfort and continuity.  We've long been set up as a company to have our people work from pretty much anywhere there's an internet connection, and all of us being able to stay in touch and collaborate easily has made that part of the transition to shelter in place straightforward.  Some of that is due to technology and infrastructure, but the largest part is company culture. We're working out ways to share those best practices with other people and companies.
		</li>
		<li>
			People are still processing all the changes and chaos in the world.  That's not surprising as a general observation but it is noteworthy to me that absolutely everyone I talk to is very much still working to sort out all the changes.  I know I am too, and it's good to be able to share that with everyone.  The first few minutes of all my work meetings and conversations is invariably (and importantly) the "how's everyone doing?" check-in.
		</li>
		<li>
			I have stopped shaving and am, for the first time in my life, seeing what sort of beard I might have.  I'm not optimistic as I've never had much to work with in that department, but then again I've never tried.  Being isolated at home seems like as good an opportunity as I'll every have, plus a bit of this feels like the "quarantine beard" analog to "playoff beards" that athletes grow.  Maybe I should just not shave for as long as we all need to shelter in place...
		</li>
	</ul>

Also, shout out to <a href="https://www.summitgrocerystore.com/">Summit Store</a>, our little neigborhood grocery here in the Santa Cruz mountains.  My only trips outside the house in the last week have been quick runs to Summit Store to reprovision.  They've been an oasis of important supplies, surprise special treats, and safe-distance connection to other folks, all of which are vital these days.  We've always been fans, but they've stepped up to be an anchor for our community.  (And I'm astonished at how well they've been able to scrounge essential items for us all.)
