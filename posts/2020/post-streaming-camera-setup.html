	My work-from-home video camera setup has always been a bit over the top as I couldn't resist geeking out and using my Sony mirrorless camera as a webcam.  The intial approach repurposed an old desktop microphone stand as a camera and light mount, which worked but wasn't very adjustable or sturdy.  Influenced by some helpful <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2020/03/24/4/tips-and-tools-for-remote-meetings-and-presentations">posts</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WedG8LKO6ks&t=419s">videos</a>, I've upgraded to a much better arrangement that wasn't all that expensive plus was fun to design and put together.  If you're curious you can read all about it in my detailed <a href="/articles/streaming_camera_stand/index.html">article</a> on the project, complete with the list of parts I used plus some tips on assembly.
