I love to travel, and want to be able to share photos and stories of my adventures when I do. On the photography side, I long ago learned that capturing my experiences the way I wanted to meant taking a good camera with me everywhere and editing the photos as part of publishing them for friends and family to see online.
<p> 
I'd like, though, to be able to travel light and in particular not always have to carry a heavy, expensive and fragile laptop. To do that I need to adapt my photo editing workflow (based on Adobe Lightroom and SmugMug) and my blogging workflow (based on Github, Eleventy, and Netlify) to something more mobile than a laptop.
</p>
<p>
I've also always traveled with an iPad, primarily for easy access to movies and books to help pass the time and inform me about places I'm visiting. Could my iPad adequately replace a laptop in my travel workflows? Apple recently (finally) enabled import of photos from removable SD card media and Adobe added photo import to the iPad version of Lightroom, so my trip is an opportunity to test that combination. Once imported and edited in Lightroom, I can upload photos to <a href="https://davidbryant.smugmug.com">SmugMug</a> anywhere I find wifi.
</p>
<p>
I've also found an app, 'Working Copy', which allows an iPad to be used for software development on Github.  I'll be testing its use for posting travel updates here on disquisitioner.com.

Watch this space for the results of those experiments.
