A 3.9 magnitude earthquake struck Morgan Hill, California at 11:17pm yesterday (1 Jan 2020).  That's only twenty-two miles from our house, so the signal was pretty strong on our home seismometer as you can see in the helicorder output above.

	That said, all of us were asleep here and none of us recalled feeling it.  Now if it had hit 24 hours earlier it could have been part of our New Year's Eve celebration...
