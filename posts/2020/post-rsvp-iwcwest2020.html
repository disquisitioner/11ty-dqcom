	Looking forward to attending this weekend's
	<a href="https://2020.indieweb.org/west" class="u-in-reply-to">IndieWebCamp West 2020</a>.
	Per my <a href="./posts/2020/post-rsvp-iws2020/">original plan</a> I would have been in Portland, Oregon this weekend for IndieWeb Summit 2020, but with COVID-19 and quarantine the Summit has been reimagined as a (first time ever) all on-line IndieWebCamp West.  All the details are <a href="https://indieweb.org/2020/West">here</a>, and the all-important <a href="https://indieweb.org/2020/West/Schedule">schedule grid</a> has info on what's happening, who's presenting, and when.

	If you're not familiar with them, the frequent local <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps/Attending">IndieWeb Camps</a> are awesome -- you should definitely attend any that happen near you to learn how to create your own independent home on the web.
