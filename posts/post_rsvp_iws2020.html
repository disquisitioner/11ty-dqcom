Looking forward to attending
<a href="https://2020.indieweb.org/summit" class="u-in-reply-to">IndieWeb Summit 2020</a> 
after having such an outstanding experience there in 2019.   The frequent local <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamps/Attending">IndieWeb Camps</a> are awesome -- you should definitely attend any that happen near you to learn how to create your own independent home on the web. Each year's overall Summit is icing on the IndieWeb cake, and as it says on the 
<a href="https://2020.indieweb.org/summit#register">event registration page</a> draws web creators of all kinds from around the world to "to share ideas, create and improve their personal websites, and build upon each other's creations."

This year's Summit is the weekend of June 27th and 28th, and once again is being hosted by Mozilla in their Portland, Oregon office.  Come join us!
