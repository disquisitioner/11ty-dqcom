	I always have a number of projects underway, but having a solid block of time away from work over the Christmas break means I can be specific about what I want to accomplish.  Here's my list as of now:
		<ul>
		<li>Learning how to build a web site with the <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> static site generator</li>
		<li>Taking SmugMug for a test drive to see if it's a better way to share my photos than Flickr</li>
		<li>Component assembly for my remote home weather sensor, which involves combining a solar panel, power converter, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3176">Adafruit Feather M0 Radio</a>, and assorted sensors in a weather-proof enclosure.</li>
		<li>Reading the wonderful books I got for Christmas</li>
		<li>Exploring the Sony a6400 camera I rented to see if it'd be worth upgrading from my beloved a6000</li>
		<li>Playing the electric guitar, given I received both the guitar and amplifier as gifts.  (I've not had an electric guitar since 10th grade, so cover your ears.)</li>
	</ul>
