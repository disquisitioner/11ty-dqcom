As part of Mozilla's company wide All Hands meeting in Berlin this past week the Emerging Technologies team of which I am a part gathered everyone for a fun, teambuilding evening.  Our creative exercise was learning how to paint street art given Berlin's widespread acclaim for that form of expression, which is the first time I'd ever done anything like that. (I guess you're just going to have to trust me there...)  Guided by some patient instructors in a studio surrounded by sections of the old Berlin Wall they'd decorated, this is the wall of art my small group produced.

It was great!  Encouraged and inspired, I need to pick up some cans of spray paint when I get back home and find a nice surface upon which to practice.
